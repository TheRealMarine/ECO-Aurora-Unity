    /// It implements following life-cycle hooks which may be overriden:
    /// - <see cref="AwakeReusableInstance"/> - called only once per instance lifecycle when <see cref="Awake"/> called by Unity or when object instantiated by Pool. It ensures you always have same life-cycle for pooled objects (rented or just instantiated).
    /// - <see cref="StartReusableInstance"/> - called only once per instance lifecycle when <see cref="Start"/> called by Unity
    /// - <see cref="InitInstance"/>          - first time called just after <see cref="AwakeReusableInstance"/> and then every time when an instance rented from pool.
    /// - <see cref="ReleaseInstance"/>       - called every time when an initialized instance returned to pool (should receive <see cref="InitInstance"/>, this callback skipped otherwise) or when an instance destroyed (called from <see cref="OnDestroy"/>), it has `destroy` argument which signals if the instance actually destroying or just released for pool.
